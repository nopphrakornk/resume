# Summary of Flowarm Integrity Optimization through Data-Driven Decision Making (DDDM) Strategy

The inspection strategy for flowarms, initially based on low corrosion rates, was revised between 2012 and 2021 following a loss of pressure containment (LOPC) due to changing damage mechanisms. An intensive inspection regimen was introduced, monitoring over 1,800 flowarms every three months, which effectively stopped leaks. In 2022, to optimize resource use while maintaining a zero-leak target, the team adopted a Data-Driven Decision Making (DDDM) approach. This method involved data cleaning, pre-analytics, and iterative weighting of parameters to determine optimal inspection intervals, starting with 3, 6, and 12 months. Field trials validated the new intervals, which were later adjusted to include 24 months, significantly reducing inspection man-hours by up to 60%.

The DDDM process, incorporating multidisciplinary input, proved more effective than traditional inspection methods by enabling dynamic adjustment of inspection intervals based on updated data. By 2023, DDDM was fully integrated into an automated inspection database, enhancing efficiency and accuracy. The process successfully prevented 47 potential leaks, ensuring sustainable operations and minimal environmental impact. The approach also has potential for further development into a predictive model and could be applied to other equipment and assets.
